Swagger integration with .net core 3.0 is not stable and generates some tags that swagger code-gen cannot process. 
In order to make code-gen work it requires to download swagger.json and conver it to .yaml. Tested convertor: https://www.json2yaml.com/
Then remove all 'additionalProperties' tags from DTO schemas.
#TODO: create script/exe to do this automatically
